# Homelab as a Service product documentation site

This documentation site uses MkDocs.

## Development

Just run `./start-dev.sh` to start up an mkdocs development container. This will mount your local working copy and will automatically update when you save changes.

Run `./stop-dev.sh` to stop the container.

Note: You will need docker installed locally for this to work.
